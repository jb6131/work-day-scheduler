# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This web application was created to provide the user with a way to schedule their day with color-coded time blocks based on the current time of day: grey time blocks are past events, a red time block is the current hour, and green time blocks are future events. The user can enter their scheduled events in each time block and save them to local storage so that the events remain in their time block even if the page refreshes. The web application also provides the current date at the top of the page.

## Usage

Clicking on a time block allows the user to enter whatever they have scheduled at that time. They can then press the blue save button on the right end of the time block to save the event to local storage.
